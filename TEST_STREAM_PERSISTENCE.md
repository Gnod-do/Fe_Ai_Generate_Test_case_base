# StreamType Persistence Test Guide

## Issue Fixed
The selected stream type (business/validation) was not persisting when refreshing the page on step 3 (Generation step).

## Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced useLocalStorage hook** in `lib/hooks.ts` to immediately read from localStorage during initialization
2. **Added localStorage loading effects** in `app/page.tsx` for step 3 persistence
3. **Created local fallback mechanism** in `components/generation-step.tsx` with:
   - Local state `localSelectedStream` that reads from localStorage when prop is null
   - `effectiveStream` variable that uses the local state with fallback to prop
   - All stream-dependent logic updated to use `effectiveStream`

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Stream Selection Persistence
1. Open the app in browser
2. Select "Business Test Cases" on step 1
3. Proceed to step 2 (file upload)
4. Proceed to step 3 (generation)
5. **Refresh the page**
6. ✅ Verify: The page should still show "Business Test Cases" selected
7. ✅ Verify: Generation button should be enabled if files are uploaded
8. ✅ Verify: No "No Test Case Type Selected" message

### Test 2: Validation Stream Persistence
1. Go back to step 1
2. Select "Validation Test Cases"
3. Proceed to step 3
4. **Refresh the page**
5. ✅ Verify: Should show "Validation Test Cases" selected

### Test 3: Console Debugging
Open browser dev tools console to see debug messages:
- "GenerationStep mounted - selectedStream: null" (on refresh)
- "selectedStream is null, checking localStorage..."
- "Setting local selectedStream to: business" (or validation)
- "Using effective stream: business" (in generation logic)

## Files Modified
- `lib/hooks.ts`: Enhanced useLocalStorage hook
- `app/page.tsx`: Added localStorage loading effects
- `components/generation-step.tsx`: Added local fallback mechanism and updated all references

## Key Changes
- Replaced all `selectedStream` references with `effectiveStream` in generation logic
- Added immediate localStorage reading when prop is null
- Maintained prop interface for component reusability
- Added extensive console logging for debugging
