# StreamType Persistence Fix - Test Instructions

## Current Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced localStorage loading** in GenerationStep component with multiple fallback mechanisms
2. **Added periodic localStorage checking** every 100ms for 3 seconds if no stream is found
3. **Improved debug logging** to track exactly what's happening during page refresh
4. **Added state tracking** to prevent infinite localStorage checking

## How to Test the Fix:

### Step 1: Set up the test scenario
1. Open browser dev tools console (F12)
2. Go to http://localhost:3001
3. Select "Business Test Cases" on step 1
4. Upload some files on step 2  
5. Go to step 3 (Generation step)
6. Check console - you should see effective stream is "business"

### Step 2: Test the page refresh
1. While on step 3, refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Watch the console logs carefully

### Expected Console Output:
```
=== Main Component Debug Info ===
Component mounted, checking localStorage...
Current selectedStream: null
Raw localStorage values:
- selectedStream: "business"
...
Initial localStorage check - storedStream: "business"
Initial localStorage - parsed stream: business
GenerationStep mounted - selectedStream: null
GenerationStep mounted - localSelectedStream: business
=== GenerationStep Debug Info ===
selectedStream prop: null
localSelectedStream state: business  
effectiveStream: business
```

### What Should Happen:
✅ The generation step should show "business" (or whatever you selected) as the effective stream
✅ The generate button should be enabled 
✅ No "No Test Case Type Selected" error
✅ The stream type should be preserved across page refreshes

### If It Still Doesn't Work:
- Check if localStorage actually contains the selectedStream value
- Look for any error messages in console
- Verify the periodic localStorage check is running and finding the value

## Debug Commands (Run in Browser Console):
```javascript
// Check what's in localStorage
console.log('selectedStream:', localStorage.getItem('selectedStream'))
console.log('currentStep:', localStorage.getItem('currentStep'))

// Manually set a test value
localStorage.setItem('selectedStream', '"business"')

// Clear localStorage to start fresh
localStorage.clear()
```

The fix should now work with multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure the stream type persists even during page refresh hydration issues.
